# Suicide-Detection
For suicide detection we plan of using an LLM model to classify textual data that we get from a dataset. Then through LLM fine tuning we then classify these data as either suicide or non suicide. The model is given social media data that includes tweets, messages, and other forms of online communication, it should be able to isolate those with depressive and suicidal tendencies and separate those that are neutral, normal and happy.
