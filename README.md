# Suicide-Detection
Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
First, we will gather a dataset consisting of social media posts. The raw data will undergo preprocessing, which involves cleaning the text by removing unnecessary elements such as special characters, links, and irrelevant hashtags. We will also perform tokenization, a process that breaks down text into smaller units, like words or phrases, making it easier for the LLM to analyze.

Step 2: Model Selection
We will start with a pre-trained LLM, which has already learned basic language patterns and structures from large amounts of text data. Examples of such models include GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) or similar architectures. By using a pre-trained model, we can leverage its understanding of human language to save time and computational resources.

Step 3: Fine-Tuning the Model
To make the LLM effective at suicide detection, we will fine-tune it using a supervised learning approach. We will provide labeled data, where each social media post is tagged as either "suicidal," "depressive," or "neutral/normal/happy." During fine-tuning, the model will learn to associate specific language patterns, phrases, and emotional cues with each category. This process involves adjusting the modelâ€™s parameters to optimize its performance in this specific classification task.

Step 4: Feature Extraction
The LLM will use semantic analysis to understand the meaning of words in context. It will look for linguistic features such as sentiment, tone, and language patterns that often indicate depressive or suicidal thoughts. For instance, phrases expressing hopelessness or self-harm intentions will be flagged differently from those expressing positive or neutral sentiments.

Step 5: Classification and Output
Once trained, the model will be able to process new social media posts and classify them as:

Suicidal Tendencies: Posts that exhibit language strongly associated with a risk of self-harm or suicide.
Depressive Tendencies: Posts that contain signs of sadness, hopelessness, or other depressive symptoms but do not indicate an immediate risk.
Neutral/Normal/Happy: Posts that do not show any depressive or suicidal indicators and are instead neutral or positively oriented.
